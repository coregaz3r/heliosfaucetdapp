# Unofficial Helios Testnet Faucet

A simple, user-friendly decentralized application (DApp) to get free testnet tokens for the Helios blockchain network. This tool is designed for developers who need test assets to deploy and test their smart contracts in a development environment.

## ðŸ“– About The Project

In blockchain development, testing smart contracts on a live network requires tokens to pay for gas fees and interactions. A "faucet" is a developer tool that provides a small amount of free testnet tokens to users upon request. These tokens have no real-world value and are intended solely for testing purposes.

This Unofficial Helios Faucet allows developers to quickly and easily fund their wallets with testnet HLS tokens, enabling them to test their applications on the Helios testnet without spending any real assets.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Easy Token Requests:** Get testnet HLS tokens with a single click.
* **Wallet Integration:** Connects seamlessly with browser wallets like MetaMask.
* **Simple Interface:** A clean and intuitive user interface for a hassle-free experience.
* **Built with Modern Tech:** Developed using React and Vite for a fast and responsive front-end.
